# timer.lua
Starts when you press L and ends when you press R. It clears when you load a save state. AND it could be used for any SNES game, not just DKC1. This only works on Snes9x rr.
# best.lua
Next we have an upgraded timer for you. This will show you your best. Also compatible with any game, this works exactly the way the other one does.
# invinc.lua
This is pretty special. This lua script makes you invincible to ANYTHING. However, there is a catch. The L button turns this feature on while R turns it off. It is useful off in practicing SJRs.
# cursed.lua
Inspired by Newageretrohippies "cursed cart", this script enables X to fly! Enjoy!
